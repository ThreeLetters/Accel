# acceljs - Public Apology

Public Apology to @austinksmith

I (Andrews54757), apologise for infringing upon Hamsters.js. I am very sorry, and it will never happen again. I should have known that I have done something wrong, but I was ignorant. I am truly sorry for copying hamsters.io, and I have fully removed all content deemed infringing. I am very sorry for the inconvenience, and I wish him goodwill.

Andrew S
